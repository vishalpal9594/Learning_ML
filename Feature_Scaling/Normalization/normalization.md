<h2>Normalization</h2>
<p>
  Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information.
  <br> 
  it's normalized value is in range of [0-1]<br>
    <br><b>types of normalization are:</b>
    <br>1.minmax scaling
    <br>2.mean normalization
    <br>3.absolute max 
    <br>4.robust scaling
