<p>
Feature scaling comes into picture when features of the input data set have large differences between their ranges, or simply when they are measured in different measurement units (e.g., Pounds, Meters, Miles â€¦ etc).
  
Feature Scaling is a technique to standardize the independent features present in the data in a fixed range.
  
Any machine learning algorithm that computes the distance between the data points needs Feature Scaling (Standardization and Normalization).
