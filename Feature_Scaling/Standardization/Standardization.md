<h1> Standardization </h1>
<p>
The idea behind using standardization before applying machine learning algorithm is to transform you data such that its distribution will have <b>mean value 0 and standard deviation as 1</b>.
</p>

<h3>Z-SCORE</h3>
<p> 
Z-score is one of the most popular methods to standardize data, and can be done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each value of each feature.

<h4> Standardization does not get affected by outliers because there is no predefined range of transformed features.</h4>
