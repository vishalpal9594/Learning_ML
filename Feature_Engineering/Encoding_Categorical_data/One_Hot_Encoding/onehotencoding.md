<h1>One Hot Encoding</h1>
<p>
 We use this categorical data encoding technique when the features are nominal(do not have any order). In one hot encoding, for each level of a categorical feature, we create a new variable. Each category is mapped with a binary variable containing either 0 or 1. Here, 0 represents the absence, and 1 represents the presence of that category.
<br>
These newly created binary features are known as Dummy variables. The number of dummy variables depends on the levels present in the categorical variable.
