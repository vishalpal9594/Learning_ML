<h1>Complete Case Analysis</h1>
<P>
  Complete case analysis also called "list-wise deletion" of cases, consists in discarding Row where value in any of the column are missing.
  <br>
  Complete case analysis is the term used to describe a statistical analysis that only includes participants for which we have no missing data on the variables of interest.
  <br><br>
  best advaice to use CCA only where missing value at random becouse the distribution of data can not be change.
  <br>
  Distribution of data before removing missing value shound be equal to Distribution of data after revoing missing value
