<h1>KNN</h1>

<p>
  A similar imputation methodology that works on data is k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) that identifies the neighboring points through a measure of distance and the missing values can be estimated using completed values of neighboring observations.
  <br>
  The idea in kNN methods is to identify ‘k’ samples in the dataset that are similar or close in the space. Then we use these ‘k’ samples to estimate the value of the missing data points. Each sample’s missing values are imputed using the mean value of the ‘k’-neighbors found in the dataset.
